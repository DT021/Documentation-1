## Donchian Channel on the Charts

<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/donchianchannels.asp" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According to Investopedia</a>, "Donchian Channels are three lines generated by moving average calculations that comprise an indicator formed by upper and lower bands around a mid-range or median band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over N periods while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over N periods. The area between the upper and lower bands represents the Donchian Channel. Career futures trader Richard Donchian developed the indicator in the mid-twentieth century to help him identify trends. He would later be nicknamed The Father of Trend Following."
