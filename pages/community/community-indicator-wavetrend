## Wave Trend On the Charts

Wave Trend Oscillator is a port of a famous TS/MT indicator and all credits goes to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/2KE8wTuF-Indicator-WaveTrend-Oscillator-WT/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lazy Bear</a> who coded this indicator for tradingview in 2014.

When plotted, the Wavetrend indicator appears similar to RSI or MACD but it has a fixed range from -100 to 100 and it is composed of 2 lines, the Wavetrend line and a Signal line. On the chart is plotted an histogram too, that is the difference betweend the two lines.
When the Wavetrend is above the overbought band (blue horizontal fixed lines) and crosses down the signal line, it is usually a good SELL signal. Similarly, if the Wavetrend crosses above the signal line when below the oversold band (yellow horizontal fixed lines), it is a good BUY signal. This oscillator can also be used to spot divergences.
 
Standar values for the indicator are:
- Value for Channel Length is 10
- Value for Average Length is 21
- Value for First Over Bought Level is 60
- Value for Second Over Bought Level is 53
- Value for First Over Sold Level is -60
- Value for Second Over Sold Level is -53

I made it easy to change the parameters needed for the calculation as per your needs. Locate and open the Javascript Code under Data Building Procedure -> Procedure Loop under Wavetrend Product Definition
