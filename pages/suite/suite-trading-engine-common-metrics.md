As explained elsewhere, Superalgos keeps track of a number of metrics across many different contexts, and all of this information is made available both to the user through the design space visual environment, and to trading systems through simple syntax.

This section of the documentation covers each of the metrics available, in detail. Each definition may feature specific iformation explaining how certain accounts are kept or metrics calculated. In most cases, the explanations provide details on how the calculation of a certain metric may vary depending on the context.
