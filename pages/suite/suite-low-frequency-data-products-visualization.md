The Low-Frequency trading bot outputs tens of data products, which are made available for others to use through the data structure provided by the Low-Frequency <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.trading_engine.trading_engine}}">trading engine</a> hierarchy, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.trading_system.trading_system}}">trading system</a> involved in the trading session, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.time_machine}}">time machines</a> installed to visualize the trading simulations.

The *Trading Bot Layers* interactive tutorial available in the Weak-Hands Buster v.2 plugin workspace covers all the trading bot features that enable the visualization of trading information:

* Visualization of simulations over the chart for all types of trading sessions.

* Visualization of all the trading information managed by the trading bot on the trading engine hierarchy.

* Visualization of event highlights, values, warnings, errors, and general information concerning the trading system.
