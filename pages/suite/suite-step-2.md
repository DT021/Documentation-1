## Start Here

**1. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superalgos repository</a>** within the Superalgos organization in GitHub. Make sure you are in the Master branch.

**2. Click the green *Clone or download* button** on the right-hand side of the page. If you are a developer, feel free to clone the repository, otherwise, click the Download ZIP button.

**3. Extract the ZIP file** in an accessible location on your local drive. For your convenience, don't put it too deep within a folder structure as you will launch the system from this location.

{% include note.html content="If you extract the file with default options, the resulting name of the folder is ```Superalgos-master```. This is how we will refer to the folder from now on. If you are cloning the repository instead of downloading a ZIP file, the folder name will likely be ```Superalgos```." %}
