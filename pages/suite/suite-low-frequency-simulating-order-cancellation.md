Simulating the cancelation of an order is almost trivial. Of course, the process applies to backtesting and paper trading sessions only.

The order is closed seamlessly as the bot has full control over the orderâ€™s details.

```
tradingEngineOrder.status.value = 'Closed'
```

Once the order is closed, the bot runs the calculations to adjusts the stage size (see [Accounting](suite-low-frequency-accounting.html)).
