This video series focuses on the "how to" aspect of building an indicator. It does not go through definitions nor does it explain the underlying concepts. Therefore, it is highly recommended to read the [data mines](suite-data-mines.html) page as well as the pages about [indicator bots](suite-indicator-bots.html) before attempting to build an indicator. 

{% include note.html content="Reading the whole documentation on indicators and plotters is certainly desirable and will save you time in the long run." %}

{% include important.html content="The video series on how to build an indicator was produced for the Beta 5 version of the system, however, Beta 6 works similarly in these regards. That said, there may be minor differences that are yet to be documented. Please drop by the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdevelop' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Develop group</a> and ask any questions you may have, particularly if something is not working as expected, or as instructed in the videos." %}
