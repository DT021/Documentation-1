## Start Here

**1. Go to the ```Superalgos-master``` folder** you extracted from the ZIP file on the prior step.

**2. Open a console/terminal/command line** inside the ```Superalgos-master``` folder. If you are on Windows, your console may open in a different directory.

**3. Type ```node run```** and hit *Enter* to launch the system.

## The Welcome Tutorial Takes Over

Once the app finishes loading, an interactive tutorial takes you by the hand and walks you all around the system, while you learn the basic skills required to use the interface. It is highly recommended you follow the tutorial until the end, as it is carefully crafted to make your onboarding as easy as possible.

{% include note.html content="The tutorial uses Binance as the exchange of choice. If you don't have an account with Binance, you will still be able to follow 85% of the tutorial. The remaining 15% involves running a live trading session, which requires an account with the exchange. You may learn how to work with other exchanges later on." %}
