## Use Chrome, the Only Tested Browser

Before you begin, it is highly recommended that you <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">install Chrome</a> and set it up as your default browser.

{% include important.html content="Use Chrome so that you have a similar environment as the dev team in case you need help. We are not testing on any other browsers, and it is a well-known fact that browsers behave differently." %}

## Install Node JS

Please install Node JS, an open-source server environment required to run Superalgos. 

**1. Go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Node JS downloads page</a>**.

**2. Download your system's installer** (the *LTS Recommended for Most Users* version is enough).

**3. Run the installer** and go through the process until Node JS is fully installed.

## Procure a Good Console/Terminal/Command Line App

You launch the software from your console/terminal/command line application. Also, processes started from within the system log their activity on the console used to fire up the system. Therefore, the console is a fundamental piece of software to operate the system. Windows Command Prompt is particularly bad as a console. If you are on Windows, it is recommended to install and use a decent application, such as <a href="https://cmder.net/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Console Emulator Cmder<a/>. This will save you time and hassle, and make the operation of the system more enjoyable. 

## Are You Upgrading to a New Version of Superalgos?

If you have run Superalgos before, read the best practices for [upgrading the system](suite-upgrading-your-existing-instalation.html) as a reminder, and take your time before you commit to the upgrade.
