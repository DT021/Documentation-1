You may define shortcuts for frequently-used nodes with the following procedure:

1. Hover the mouse pointer over the target node until the menu opens up. This puts the node *in focus*.
1. Click <kbd>Ctrl or &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + your preferred key to assign the shortcut.
1. A sign will appear below the node confirming the assignation of the shortcut.

Repeat the same procedure to remove a shortcut.
