As explained in greater detail in the [base asset and quoted asset](suite-trading-engine-base-asset-and-quoted-asset.html) page next in the menu, the trading engine keeps track of accounts for both assets. Each set of accounts may be of use in different settings.

The trading engine also keeps track of several performance metrics, counters, and statistics.

{% include callout.html type="success" content="All of this information may exist in different contexts, for example, in the context of the episode, a position, a strategy stage, and even a particular exchange order." %}

The following pages list all of those contexts in which accounts, counters, and statistics are provided.
