**The new version features a complete re-write of the trading engine, and is equipped with a very robust order execution system that provides full control over the placing and management of orders. The new trading engine makes all the information processed by the trading bot available to trading systems, so that your strategies become aware of what is going on at all times, and may act accordingly.**

{% include important.html content="The main challenge with testing the unreleased version is that it is not completely documented yet. The Beta 6 documentation is being crafted as testing advances. Therefore, you need a good understanding of how Superalgos works from having used the current and/or previous versions, so that you may follow the few explanations available and figure out the new functionality as you go." %}

## Download and Install the Software in the ```develop``` Branch

Superalgos Beta 6 is available in the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/tree/develop' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>```develop``` branch of the Superalgos repository</a>.

{% include tip.html content="You may keep your current installation of Beta 5 and run Beta 6 from a different folder. Beta 6 runs on a different port, so you may have two independent installations. If you copy your ```Data-Storage``` folder to the new installation you may save the hassle to run the whole data-mining operation for Beta 6." %}

## Workspace

When you run Beta 6 for the first time, the default workspace is loaded. This workspace may be updated at any point, as it is kept up-to-date with changes in the system.

{% include tip.html content="You may also want to try other workspaces that may be available in the ```My-Workspaces``` folder. If you do, you may want to change the name of your version of these workspaces so that it is not replaced once you choose to update Beta 6 to catch up with system changes during the testing phase." %}

## Join Developers and Testers in the Develop Group

Users testing Beta 6 meet in the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdevelop' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Superalgos Develop Telegram Group</a>. All questions and issues concerning Beta 6 must be channeled through this group.

## Notes on Beta 6

The lead developer has been sharing some notes on what's new in Beta 6 and how to use the new features and functionality. You may find those notes by searching for the ```#beta6``` tag in the Develop group.

## Documentation (WIP)

The work-in-progress <a href='https://julian-molina.github.io/Documentation/suite-hierarchy-trading-engine.html' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>documentation site for Beta 6</a> is a fork of the official Beta 5 documentation, being updated with content related to Beta 6. New pages and pages that have been updated are marked as <span style="color: #fd6a33;">*&#8592; New*</span> on the menu.

{% include tip.html content="Keep in mind that some information in the documentation does not reflect how the system works in Beta 6. It's important to read the lead developer's notes in the Develop group to become aware of what are the main system areas that have changed." %}
