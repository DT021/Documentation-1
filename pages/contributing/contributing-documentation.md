We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to the documentation and truly appreciate your help! 

These pages cover everything you need to know to become proficient at documenting new functionality, maintaining existing pages, and helping evolve the documentation to better serve users.

## Generalities

The documentation site is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>static site</a> created with <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a> and hosted by <a href='https://pages.github.com/' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>GitHub Pages</a> directly from the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Documentation' target='_blank'>Documentation repository</a>.

## Attribution

The site uses an adapted version of the <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Jekyll Doc Theme 6.0</a> by <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Tom Johnson</a>.

The authorship of each piece of content is indicated by the contributor's identity in the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Documentation' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Documentation repository</a>.

## Documentation Goals

Needless to say, the documentation must pursue the ultimate goal of making Superalgos usable by explaining what the system is, what it does, how it works, and how it may be used.

However, with a vast and complex system, the above is not enough. The documentation must also constantly evolve and innovate to substantially soften the learning curve and lower barriers of entry.

## Information Structure

Conceptually, information is structured in horizontal layers. The bottom layers of information provide the substance that layers built on top feed from by reusing content and further elaborating on it.

At a glance, these are the layers that make up the current documentation:

1. **Node definitions**: The layer provides an atomized explanation of what the system does at the scope of each node in each of the hierarchies.

1. **Hierarchy definitions**: The scope of this layer expands to the hierarchy level, providing context on how nodes interact, integrating the definitions of each node, presenting them in a logical sequence, and explaining how each hierarchy interacts with the rest.

1. **How to**: The layer features step-by-step tutorials for both specific and broad operations, many of which transcend a single hierarchy. This layer may include written guides and video tutorials.

1. **Special features**: Provides extensive detail on certain system capabilities and their potential uses.

On top of these four layers, more layers may and should eventually be built to fulfill the goals declared earlier, such as:

5. **Use cases**: The layer analyzes specific use cases and provides solutions for specific user needs.
