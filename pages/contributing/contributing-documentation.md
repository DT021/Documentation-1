## New to Superalgos?

If you are just getting started with Superalgos, you may help by taking notes on what may be improved in the Getting Started Guide and the overall experience of your first contact with the system and the documentation.

Once you gain a little bit of experience with Superalgos, you may be able to formulate concise proposals on how to improve the experience for new users.

Also, this is the stage in which you will be reading the existing documentation and likely spotting errors, inconsistencies, or outdated content. You can help by fixing those issues yourself!

## Advanced Users

If you've been using Superalgos for a while, have thoroughly studied the documentation gaining a good understanding of how the system works, and have a knack for explaining complex concepts in English, then you may help document new, unreleased functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started contributing to the documentation, follow the next few steps:

**1. Fork the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Documentation' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Documentation repository</a>**. If you are not familiar with <a href='https://github.com/' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>, you should start with opening an account and going through some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=github+basics+tutorial' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>basic tutorials</a>. Learning GitHub is a great investment of your time, as it will open the doors to a universe of open-source projects you may contribute to!

Do not *clone* or *download* the repository. It is important that you *fork* it instead. When you fork the repository, GitHub creates a fork (a live copy) of the repository under your GitHub account. This allows GitHub to keep track of your fork and allows you to maintain your fork in sync with the upstream (original) repository, as well as submitting your contributions, via *Pull Requests* (PR).

Once you have an account, simply click the *Fork* button while standing on the <a href='https://github.com/Superalgos/Documentation' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Documentation repository</a> page.

**2. Join us on the <a href='https://t.me/superalgosdocs' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Superalgos Documentation Telegram Group</a>**. This is where people working on the docs meet, exchange ideas, and coordinate work. Needless to say, we are waiting for you and appreciate all the help you may offer!

**3. Keep reading about how the docs are built**. The next few pages help with your education about how the docs are built and the criteria we follow to make it consistent. While you read them, dive into your fork of the documentation to start acquiring some hands-on experience.
