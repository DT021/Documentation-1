## What if I need help? Do you have customer support?

Superalgos is on open Community of people pursuing a common goal. The Community is thrilled to have more people joining the cause and is happy to answer questions and help new users get started with Superalgos. It is kindly suggested to read these FAQs and the troubleshooting section in the documentation. That said, please feel free to ask questions in the <a href="https://t.me/superalgoscommunity" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Community Telegram</a>.

Superalgos is not commercial software, therefore, there is no such thing as a customer or customer support for that matter.

* **Users online support:** If you have any questions or issues running the system, or need help getting started, please ask for help in the <a href="https://t.me/superalgoscommunity" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superalgos Community Telegram</a>. <br/><br/>We love it when people show up to say hi, or offer feedback as well. Also, the community is the place where you want to be to stay up to date with recent developments and with what is cooking for the next release. It's also the place where users discuss building strategies, share work in progress, and help each other learn faster. Don't be shy! Drop by, say hi, tell us how you are using Superalgos, or let us know if you are missing any features.

* **Developers online support:** Join the <a href="https://t.me/superalgosdevelop" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Telegram Developer's Group</a>.

### May I ask for features I may be missing?

Yes. We keep a wish list for new features in the form of <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/issues" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issues in the Superalgos repository</a>. If you are missing a key feature, feel free to open an issue starting the subject with the word ```Improvement:```. Please be thorough on your explanation about what you wish and how you envision the feature should work, and make sure you follow the thread so that you may answer questions the developers may have.

We make no promises as of what features may be developed when, but we do our best to keep up with the Community's requests.
